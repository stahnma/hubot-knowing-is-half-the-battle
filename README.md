# hubot-the-battle
This is a small module to output a random (curated) image about GI Joe if somebody says "knowing is half the battle".


# License
WTFPL


# Inspiration
The internal hubot that ran at Puppet, Inc for years. It needed new images since they are now 404s.

# Installation


`npm install --save hubot-the-battle`

Add 'hubot-the-battle to your `external-scripts` file. That's all.
